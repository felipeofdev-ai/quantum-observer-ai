# Roadmap

## Vision

Quantum Observer AI aims to become a reference framework for
**explainable, uncertainty-aware, and human-aligned decision systems**.

The roadmap prioritizes:
- Real-world usability
- Incremental delivery
- Architectural integrity
- Long-term maintainability

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation (Current)

**Status:** In progress

### Objectives
- Establish conceptual clarity
- Define ethical and operational boundaries
- Formalize decision and collapse models
- Prepare for code implementation

### Deliverables
- Core documentation
- Decision lifecycle specification
- Explainability-first principles
- Ethical constraints definition

---

## Phase 2 — Core Engine Implementation

### Objectives
- Implement state superposition engine
- Implement decision collapse logic
- Define clear interfaces between modules
- Ensure deterministic and stochastic modes

### Planned Components
- Context ingestion module
- State generation engine
- Probability normalization logic
- Collapse strategy implementations

---

## Phase 3 — Explainability & Audit Layer

### Objectives
- Generate decision explanation artifacts
- Enable full traceability of decisions
- Support audit and inspection workflows

### Planned Components
- Decision trace objects
- Explanation generators
- Confidence scoring
- Reproducibility tools

---

## Phase 4 — Human-in-the-Loop Feedback

### Objectives
- Integrate observer feedback safely
- Shape probabilities without overriding logic
- Preserve decision integrity

### Planned Components
- Feedback ingestion API
- Preference modeling
- Observer influence metrics

---

## Phase 5 — Domain Adaptation

### Objectives
- Adapt the system to specific domains
- Introduce domain-specific constraints
- Validate usefulness in real scenarios

### Target Domains
- Product management
- Strategic planning
- Risk-aware finance
- AI governance and compliance

---

## Phase 6 — Multi-Agent & Advanced Models

### Objectives
- Support multiple observers
- Introduce competing observer perspectives
- Explore hybrid symbolic-probabilistic models

### Research Directions
- Multi-agent collapse strategies
- Conflict resolution between observers
- Distributed decision consensus

---

## Phase 7 — Production Readiness

### Objectives
- Improve performance and scalability
- Harden interfaces
- Add monitoring and safety checks

### Planned Enhancements
- Logging and metrics
- Stress testing
- Failure mode simulations
- Documentation expansion

---

## Guiding Principle

This roadmap favors **depth over speed**.

Every phase must:
- Preserve explainability
- Respect ethical constraints
- Avoid premature optimization

Progress is measured by **decision quality and trust**, not by feature count.
